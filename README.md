## Background
The vibrant and interdisciplinary field of machine learning has increasingly impacted many different fields of scientific study in the last 10-20 years. Current tools, such as neural networks, locally-competitive algorithms, and sparse coding have made it possible to gain insight into how the human brain analyzes and sorts the vast amounts of data it receives, as well as create machines that are capable of performing similarly, oftentimes better, than the human brain. In this simple demonstration inspired by the work of psychologist B.F. Skinner, we provide an illustration of the mechanism and power of machine learning by showing how, when implemented in an inexpensive rover with minimal hard-coding, they allow us to use operant conditioning to train the rover to perform certain behaviors in the presence of certain colors.
